# quickplot
very dumb bezier curve thing

I did this in one afternoon and probably won't update it again because it was a dumb one-off and my first foray into
pysimplegui, after this experience I think I'll just stay away from pysimplegui myself

## Known issues
 - coordinate plane setting does not work
 - lines denoting bezier points does not work (it did at one point)
 - sometimes the drawing does not update (it does update if you change one of the points, but some buttons do not update for some reason)
